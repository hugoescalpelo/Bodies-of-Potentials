# Initial Detailed Diagnosis

An extensive revision was made, confirming the main poinst of diagnosis and adding some new recommendations.

A video resume is available here https://youtu.be/R9Tb3EtviOM

## Piece A

### Reported problems

- Damage to the latex membrane after a long period of worktime.
- Water based constant lubrication is needed.
- Some motors stop working due to friction.

### Original diagnosis

- Re design of servo motor holder is needed.
- Re print of spheres with PET-G is needed.
- Substitution of Servo Motors is needed. Metalic gear will be used.
- Aluminum sheet coating to the depth wheel is recommended.
- Silicon based lubricant will be applied.

### New Discoveries

An important difference in damage to the latex membrane was noticed between Piece A and Piece B. Piece A shows damage very noticeable, piece B shows almost no damage. It might be caused due to tension or difference in tickness, but the main cause could be related to the rotary wheel using the membrane tension to reposition the spheres. A spring will be added to every wheel axis to retract without depending of the membrane tension.

The source has no specifications. Sticker with info was removed. Due to its size, power coud be insufficient, causing the motors to stop working. Measurements are in order. If insufficient, source will be replaced.

## Piece B

### Repoted problems
- Damage to the latex membrane after a long period of worktime.
- Water based constant lubrication is needed.
- Some motors stop working due to friction.

### Original diagnosis

- Re design of servo motor holder is needed.
- Re print of spheres with PET-G is needed.
- Substitution of Servo Motors is needed. Metalic gear will be used.
- Aluminum sheet coating to the depth wheel is recommended.
- Silicon based lubricant will be applied.

### New Discoveries

Circuit maintenance is needed. Some conectors are unplugged.

Driver for DC motors might be insufficient, substitusion is needed.

The source has no specifications. Sticker with info was removed. Due to its size, power might be insufficient. Testing and measurements are needed to determine if current is enough. If insufficient, source will be replaced.

Rotary DC mThe source has no specifications. Sticker with info was removed. Due to its size, power coud be insufficient, causing the motors to stop working. Measurements are in order. If insufficient, source will be replaced.

DC motor holder for rotary functions have a very noticeable missalignment, re design of holding mechanism will be performed.

## General Extras

- An extensive test is scheduled after maintenance.
- A prescence sensor will be integrated.

## Requirements

- Step files were proided.
- Electronic schematics are needed.
- Source code is needed.

## Next Steps

- This inform will be delivered to get Artist's conscent to operate the Piece A with membrane damage.
- Water based lubricant will be applied.
- Both pieces will be activated in order to determine further problems.
